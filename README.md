The main goal of the simple calculator project is to provide users with a basic tool for performing arithmetic operations. This project also serves as an educational exercise in understanding fundamental programming concepts in Java.

Key Features
User Input:

The application prompts the user to enter two numbers for the calculation.
It then asks the user to choose an operation from a list of options.
Supported Operations:

Addition (+): Adds two numbers.
Subtraction (-): Subtracts the second number from the first.
Multiplication (*): Multiplies two numbers.
Division (/): Divides the first number by the second, with a check to prevent division by zero.
User Interaction:

The program uses a console-based interface where users input their choices.
A simple menu guides the user through selecting the desired operation.
Error Handling:

The application includes basic error checking to handle invalid operations, such as division by zero.
It provides feedback if the user makes an invalid choice.
Result Display:

After performing the selected operation, the calculator displays the result of the computation to the user.
